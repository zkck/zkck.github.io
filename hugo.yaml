    Content: |
      I'm **Zak**, welcome to my blog. I'm a software engineer based in Switzerland,
      currently working at [DeepJudge](https://www.deepjudge.ai/). I've had professional experience in
      cybersecurity, software engineering, and cloud-native infrastructure. I'm
      passionate about so many topics in computer science, and love learning a little
      bit more everyday.
