Hey, I'm Zak.

I'm a software engineer based in Switzerland, currently working as an IT
consultant at [ipt](https://ipt.ch/en/). I've had professional experience in
cybersecurity, software engineering, and cloud-native infrastructure. I'm
passionate about so many topics in computer science, and love learning a little
bit more everyday.

Most recently, I've been taking a shot at writing an interpreter in Rust based
on the amazing [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book,
constantly update my
[Nix devShell](https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/declarative-shell.html)
over at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/zkck/dotfiles) repo, and am now writing
about my computer science adventures in this blog.
